title: Distributed Tracing
---

Configuring Distributed Tracing (DT) will enable you to obtain a visualization
of the call paths that take place in order to process a request made to Kratos.
It's yet another tool that you can use to aid you in profiling, debugging and
ultimately understanding your deployment of Kratos better. Kratos supports the
following tracing options:

- Tracing backend(s): Jaeger

  **Note**: Adding support for other [OpenTelemetry
  exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/exporting_data/)
  is planned. To aid in priority, please [create an
  issue](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues) with your feature
  request. However, official support in OpenTelemetry only exists for
  the exporters listed
  [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/tree/main/exporters).
  Other backends can be technically "supported" by sending spans to the
  OpenTelemetry Collector agent, and configuring the collector to push
  spans to whatever [backend of your choice](
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter).

- Following existing traces: If you have deployed Kratos behind a proxy
  that has initiated a trace, Kratos will attempt to join that trace by
  examining the request headers for tracing context. At present, support
  for Jaeger and Zipkin (B3) spans exists; support for additional
  formats like Trace Context and Baggage is planned.

### What a Kratos trace includes

In DT speak, a trace is comprised of one or more spans which are logical units
of work. Each Kratos span is encapsulated with the following state:

- A name
- A start time
- A finish time
- A set of zero or more tags

Kratos creates the following spans:

- Top level span (_named after the request path_) for the requested endpoint.
  Span tags: - http method - http status code - error IFF status code >= 400
- Child span will be created if bcrypt is called. Span tags: - bcrypt work
  factor
- All SQL database interactions. Spans/tags will vary depending on the database
  driver used.

This is still evolving and subject to change as tracing support continues to
expand in Kratos. If you see something that's missing/wrong, please create an
issue.
